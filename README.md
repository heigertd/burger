# burger

Installations: You will need mysql, express, and express-handlebars to run this application

Usage: To make and eat burgers!

The was made to help us gain profiency in connecting our backend to our frontend. We used orms to make the selection quereys easier. Id say this assignment also helped emphasized how great sequelize can be so we dont have to take the time writing out own orms. Doing this again, I'd probably clean up the css and make it look nicer, but thats a project for another day.
